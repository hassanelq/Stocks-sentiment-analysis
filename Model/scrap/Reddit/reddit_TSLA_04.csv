2024-11-04 14:16:09,"11/4/2024 Daily Plays Welcome to the DOW 30 NVDA ! Index funds are good! In EVER 17.25 took the loss on CAR 95 took on many longs last week, huge earnings week Watching ANF GM MCY ELF in MU ACMR CPRI STX ASPN afraid to add too many longs in case of rug pull Liked FRPT earnings valuation! RDDT CVNA Good morning everyone. Wow! CAR was up almost 25% with the daily high of 102 on Friday. WOW! I was in 2 blocks of 100 shares at 98.50 and 115. I had been stuck in the 115 block for about 5-6 months, the 98.50 block about 3 months. When the year started I wasn’t getting killed on value plays WBA PERI TITN CVS HRZN so I kept trading CAR and got stuck. I originally got in CAR because the PE was near 5 and had been trading with a 6-7x PE for some time. But when I got in initially it was about 122… It was coming off of eh earnings. Not good, not bad, but definitely disappointing. The stock took a nose dive from 160. Of course we an not trade in hindsight. Looking over all my trades on CAR, I still made over 13k after the loss. I did about 50 rounds. Meaning my avg profit was close to 300. My high was almost 1,000 and my low without losses was about 50, just resetting my position. The earnings Thursday was not good again… Not bad…. But not good. I give it a 60… It is just so cheap, and some statements in the 10Q show that going forward the margins will be much higher, this is due to new fleet being more efficient. I have to wait at least 30 days for the tax loss to set in… and I wouldn’t pay the 95 that I sold it at. My avg was about 106 on the last 200 shares.

I am on the fence about value plays… I did take a position in CPRI at 19.50….This is a value play because earnings have come down, sales have come down, the valuation has cratered with the news of a deal off with TPR. The PE is near 8, it kind of deserves this PE… at that same time I think it is human nature when we see a stock cheap that it can turn around and race to highs! The truth of the matter is that you do stand to make a ton on a turn around story..

CVNA , December 2022 was 3!!! It just hit 260, that is 9,000% in less than 2 years!

Just please, please do not think this is the story for everyone…

I wanted to lead with this because I have been reading into CVNA earnings. I do have 160 puts that will expire worthless in less than 2 weeks. The turn around did take the 4-6 quarters for the 1 out of 10 companies that do….. NVDA was a bat out of hell! CVNA did this with dilution, high interest loans, convertible bonds… It did buy them time… and I have said for 3-4 quarters that the surface has been very impressive.

 

CVNA has 7.1 Billion in debt, 5.4 billion long term. What is beneficial to the company is most of this debt is not due for years. Most of this debt has interest rates at 12-14%!!! There interest cost this past quarter was 157 million. There interest cost on the year will be about 650 million. It is also most important to note that 224 million of earnings this quarter were selling off loans to a 3^(rd) party. This is completely legal. I am just saying this is not a sustainable business model. This is because the average CVNA customer has bad credit and gets rates above 10%... CVNA realizes the gains quickly by selling off the loans for a profit.. not the same profit as holding the loans till maturity, but lets the 3^(rd) party take the risk and make more… Completely legal, TLSA does this too, but I imagine the TSLA customer has 700+ credit score… So people ask how does CVNA make 7,000+ per car and KMX makes 2,000+… Bad loans and shafting customers… This once again is legal! But if the loans go delinquent the 3^(rd) party wont buy anymore, and I do not know there agreement with CVNA and if CVNA will take a hit from this… But I wanted to see how and why CVNA was knocking it out of the park. The PE because of these amazing earnings has come down to 160… Insane but the earnings were very good… Just be careful…

A lot of people were asking me about CVNA. CVNA also has authorization to sell 1 billion in shares… It is very hard to get a faire value on something with bad financials… So if I had to.. I would say 30x ? Earnings are looking around 1.50… So 45? I am not saying it will fall to 45, but maybe at 45 it is worth the risk?

What happens if they sell 1 billion in shares? What happens if they cant sell these loans in the future? They still are on the hook for 7+ billion at a cost of near 650 million a year!

 

Big election tomorrow. Rate decision Thursday. I got many longs last week. I will be very careful!

Some earnings from this morning:

ENFN 60     FTDR 65     SSP 70    SLQT 60    PEG 70    MAR 60    NYT 60    BAM 60

KNF 60    NSSC 60    AMG 65    DOCN 75    TGTX 55    FIS 70    ZTS 70    CEG 65

L 70     YUMC 65   



 

5 Trade Ideas:

ACMR EVER MU – I will try and make 200-500 on each I am in 500 ACMR at 18.75, 250 EVER at 17.25, 100 MU at 100

 

CPRI – Thinking of holding for 21? I am in 250 at 19.50, will TPR get the deal done? They were buying in the 50s? There is a white knight

 

GM MCY – These both had very recent earnings and were awesome! They both have been dipping hard

 

ANF ELF – Last earnings these both were very good and have both come off hard, are they going to rock earnings this time?

 

RDDT RBLX CVNA – Put ideas, just ideas if we sell off, I have been waiting for downside conviction

[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/wygr3l/bridgebuilder_in_the_unknown/) | [Prev](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1gdzqzp/bridgebuilder_chapter_111/)

Alex carefully crept the GX8 along the flightline, right up to what he assumed was the launch marker on the ground, and brought it to a stop. Hovering there on the gravitics while waiting for the very impenetrable capital-ship class shielding that currently obstructed the shuttlebay exit to be lowered. 

“That is correct, we *will* be taking the Masamune. No, send my shuttle along as well, better to have it should we wish to depart at different times.” Eleya had figured out the comms quickly, holding a headset up to her face with the earcup tucked partway into the fluffy triangle of her own ear, and was now getting them clearance to depart. “Keep the security detail on there as well. I have my guard, but this will be a good practice. We will take advantage of that.”

He had slightly jumped the gun. Set off *a lot* of alarms when he lifted off, which as it turns out was something you were supposed to ask to do first. Which he knew. It was a stupid mistake driven by excitement that he should have managed better, particularly while in command of a ship, particularly with the fucking *Empress* sitting behind him. Lesson learned, no harm this time.

Based on what he’d heard so far, their escort wasn’t ready, so he went ahead and landed again while they waited. Used low-ready on the landing gear since it didn’t sound like they’d be disembarking. It was a neat feature that was largely not found on modern ships, which just put the exterior doors in more convenient locations so the struts didn’t need multiple settings.

Gave him time to actually dial in the destination, too. Not like he had a line of sight on McFadden. It wasn’t even a speck, a hundred and ten million kilometers away, and he was facing the wrong direction. Navicomp said they could do it in two hours, if they pushed the envelope of the inertial dampers. It didn’t even have kinetic buffers, which now that he was sitting in the cockpit of a real GX8 that could theoretically turn him into a very fine paste if not for a host of safeties, felt like a big issue. That seemed like something Carbon would have a fix for, or at least an idea on how to improve.

“Excellent. Would you verify the speed limits on the diplomatic lanes? Yes, very good. It is quite the distance, that will make it much more tenable. This channel will be open, let me know when we have clearance to depart.” She clicked the mic off and set the headset down, brushing the fluff in her ear out.

He had a pretty pertinent question waiting for her. “Hey, uh... how many g’s are Tsla’o capable of handling?”

There was a long pause. “That translation comes through as a question about how many of the seventh letter of your alphabet we can manage. Given it is a single letter, I imagine it is quite a few.”

Got him pretty literally there. Suppose it could have been worded better. “How many gravity of acceleration?”

“Gravity, as in the gravitational constant?”

“No, a ‘gee’ is the gravity of Earth. Denoted as a lowercase ‘g’ in physics, while the constant is a capital of the same letter.”

“Of Earth. The planet I am not from and have never visited?” Eleya had gotten a little snippy about the alarms. “I would just happen to know the mass of it and thus be able to calculate the local gravity so I could compare it to the gravity of a planet I am more familiar with?”

He waved her off. “Alright, jeeze. I get it.”

She rolled her eyes as loudly as possible, a huff punctuating her annoyance. “Tell me you have some other metric to calculate acceleration rather than, what is that, a multiple of how fast something falls on your planet?”

“How about meters per second squared? Translator like that one more?”

“Is that a Human second or a Tsla’o second?” She asked, absolutely deadpan before a hint of humor curled into her words. “Those are more standard, I should be able to calculate the difference without much trouble.”

He listened to her unlock her comm and start tapping away at it. Even if they didn’t push the engines past what the dampers could manage they’d be there in plenty of time. Alex locked the controls and slid the pilot’s seat back from the ready, twisting around to look at Eleya.

She glanced up at him for a moment then returned to tapping away at a conversion calculator. 

He’d been going back and forth on the idea of the intrusion package for the last few days in the few moments of free time he had. Not so much about the legality of it, as something like this was likely just as illegal as the monitoring software that the ONI had planted in his head. Just the morality of it.

Alex turned away, sitting back in the seat as he pulled his own comm out and sent her a message. <I’m not sure I can upload the intrusion.> They had gotten English in the system remarkably fast, a text translator becoming an optional module. The included keyboard looked nothing like the one from his phone - the key layout was based on their keyboard - that Imperial Intelligence had checked for further intrusions, but it was the exact same color scheme. He suspected that was related.

Eleya didn’t react to his message but the reply came quickly. <Is there an issue with your hardware?>

<No, I’m just wondering if this really is the right thing to do.> Where did he draw the line between what he and Carbon had lost, and the potential harm this could do to the Confederation? It was all guesswork. Yes, Eleya - The Butcher - promised that she would use it with the utmost care. Surgical information gathering, not a strategic destruction of what they all assumed was ONI.

<I may be the wrong person to ask.> She cleared her throat, “it seems to be about fifty meters per second squared, before you get into requiring special equipment or dampening.”

“Oh, that’s well within the envelope.” That was right around five g’s, so they could squeeze a little bit of fun in. <Yeah, I know. But you’re here, and you’ve got the most life experience of anyone I can talk to covertly right now.> 

Eleya locked her comm unit and slipped it back into her *daman*, idly poking through the computer at the navigation station. <Point taken. A moral issue, then? Concerned about the potential for treason? As I have explained before, utmost care has been taken to make this appear as a Human made intrusion done by a non-state actor.>

How the fuck was she doing that? Did she get a comm link implanted too? He checked who he was sending messages to, and yes, it was Eleya. <A moral issue, yeah. I mean treason as well, but moral quandary first. I feel like I’m well into treason territory from everything else already.>

<Curious. How? Was enough not taken from you and your beloved? I saw a fire in you once in regards to this theft, has it gone cold?>

He had been heated about this, sitting there with all those interface needles laced into his head, ready to fight about who got to keep what until somebody put a gun to his head. It still rankled him, absolutely, and thinking about it rekindled the flame easily. <I just don’t know if this is right. I’ve always been reasonably happy with the Confederation as a government. I know it’s not perfect but I guess I just feel like I’m betraying them.>

She laughed and continued exploring the local system map on the navicomp. <Are you serious?>

Alex didn’t react to that. He really wanted to, but he kept himself nice and orderly, save for an annoyed sigh. <Of course!>

<That is what you worry about? Betraying a government that has gravely betrayed you already? I do not know each grain of sand that you have lost, but Carbon’s reaction speaks loudly. Some of it was intensely personal. For what? The chance you would stumble upon a secret worth stealing for them? Perhaps a little leverage? Though I suppose they could view your betrayal of your kind as the original motive.>

He could see her scrolling through nearby systems on the HUD, none of which they could reach without a ferry if they wanted to be there in a reasonable amount of time. <What’s that supposed to mean, betrayal of my kind?> He typed that really hard.

“Who in the hells are you talking to?” Eleya inquired, probably covering for his sudden burst of emphatic thumbstrokes. <Humanity, dearest nephew. You pursued and won over an alien instead of one of your own. You lie in bed with her, apparently in every sense of the phrase. It is not like your kind are lacking in numbers, but you have turned your back on them.>

<That’s not the same, at all.> This was annoying because he was now sure that Carbon probably saw their relationship as some sort of betrayal of the Tsla’o and was just keeping that hidden from him. “I’m explaining to Amalu how wrong his opinions on *Oceanside Quartet* are.”

<Are you sure it is not? Had you not desired this connection, you never would have been seen as a conduit, potentially one that is disposable. You would have gone along your life as a pilot or whatever you might have decided, unburdened.>

<I care about my people! I am a Human, for fuck’s sake. Just because I fell in love with someone who isn’t doesn’t mean I’ve turned my back on them. Just as Carbon hasn’t turned her back on the Tsla’o.> He tried to dial himself back a little bit, reel the emphatic typing in to ‘disagreeing with a friend’ levels. He tapped out an addendum quickly. <I was just a pilot. There are hundreds eager to take my place in that role. Humanity will be fine without me scanning planets for them, it will keep on going with or without my involvement.>

<You feel you may damage something important?> The reply came, then a statement out loud. “I just found out it was a movie before it was redone as an opera.”

<Yes! The Confederation isn’t perfect. Nothing can be perfect, but it keeps the majority of Humanity safe and I don’t know if it’s right for me to threaten that for a trillion other people because I’m pissed.> Well, that got to the heart of it for him, anyway. Maybe Eleya was a reasonable person to ask after all. “I’ve only seen the movie. How’s the opera?”

“I enjoyed it. The twist was expected, but it came together well at the end. Kanas’ falsetto was legendary, may she rest.” She clicked her way out of the navicomp and adjusted the straps on her harness. The radio chirped and her hands returned to the controls, lifting the headset to her ear again. “This is the Masamune. Cleared, third in line? Excellent, thank you.”

<I will leave the choice to you, Alex. If your conscience demands it, you know where the file resides. Destroy it, and I will trouble you no more about that potential vector. I still feel it is possibly the only path forward if you wish to truly know who has done this to you.> She set the headset down. “Did you hear that?”

“Third in line, yeah.” Alex watched the outer shielding dissolve, leaving only the ship-permeable forcefield keeping the atmosphere in. <If it does work, if we do end up with a back door to ONI or anyone else, for that matter, do I have your promise that it will not be abused?>

“Good. There are no speed limits on the way there, by the way. The only limitation is that no FTL may be used.” She set the headset down and checked her harness *again*. A real vote of confidence. <I said before I would not. I will state it again so that it is clear: nothing will be done without your prior approval. It pains me to say that, so I hope you appreciate it.>

The first shuttle launched from the other bay, proceeding out at a lackadaisical pace. Alex slid the pilot’s seat back up to the ready position and fired up the gravitics,  retracted the landing struts, popped the shields on and waited patiently as he tapped out one last reply. <I do, thank you.>

He clicked the screen off and slipped it into a cargo pocket as the second shuttle rose from behind the GX8 and glided over them, turning down to slide under the belly of the carrier. He minded his manners and waited until it was 500 meters away before nudging the throttle forward and easing it out into space, following the same path they took... though he did get a bit fancy with it. 

Alex let the ship glide out straight for a hundred meters, well past the *Sword*’s shields, and rotated it using just the maneuvering thrusters. Pointed the nose down 90 degrees and spun it a full 180 at the same time so the cockpit would be pointing ‘up’ in relation to the carrier when he turned under. The safties were on, of course. Alex couldn’t actually turn them off without disabling the ship, so they never experienced more than three g’s of force. Eleya still grunted behind him as she was slid around in her chair. 

This was a high performance ship and by god he was going to have a little fun with it. 

He goosed the throttle for real this time, jetting away before switching the flight assist on and burning around the underside of the *Sword* like he was flying in atmosphere. Nothing too wild yet, he was playing nice with Tsla’o airspace.

They slipped away quickly, a kilometer and then two clicking by as he aimed it into the diplomatic lanes that would take them to McFadden, dismissing warnings that this was only for diplomatic craft and they could be fined or arrested for using them without proper authorization. Despite the desire to just crank the throttle all the way open, he stayed the course.

The Tsla’o shuttles were technologically five generations ahead of the GX8, if not more. They’d have no trouble matching his speed in space, or exceeding it. A bit of a letdown, yes, but blowing past the escorts was a stupid idea, and he wasn’t really in a position to do stupid stuff anymore. Selected the second shuttle and set the navicomp to follow it at safe distance, locked at a mere one g felt acceleration, then closed the cockpit armor. Nothing much to look at right now.

He slid the chair back and plucked the pilot’s eyes from the little storage nook in the seat and slipped them on. A slightly macabre name for what was just a wearable hud. Classic tech that looked like a pair of glasses, giving him a handy way to keep an eye on things without having to actually be in the chair the whole time. Maybe it was just a trip to the head, maybe you wanted to go mingle a little during the multi-hour jaunt. 

Theoretically, this ship could be piloted by a single person and sent sailing across the solar system if you wanted. Be a long trip, though.

“Is that projecting into your eyes?” Eleya inquired as he turned around and stood up, leaning against the acceleration.

He shrugged. “Yeah, basically. Told you, this thing is a classic.”

“Turn the ship around, I will take my shuttle.” She unbuckled and followed him into the main cabin. “More seriously, I understand that there is a bar in here, allegedly stocked with Human made alcohol. I must admit, I am curious as to what Humanity produces.”

“Let’s find out what they left on board.” The wet bar was quite obviously straight at the back of the cabin. Eleya’s guards were sitting in the first two seats, cloak off as they were buckled in. The juxtaposition of those luxuriously plush, white leather seats and the military hardware sitting in them was funny. ""Hey guys.""

It was pretty much what he expected for powered armor. Gray armor plating over a black undersuit, full helmets that echoed the shape of their heads. Thin slits for the eyes, green glass surrounded by a network of sensors. They did not seem particularly bothered by him, at least. 

Alex crouched down in front of the cabinet and popped the doors open. “Well, I’ll be.”

“I am unfamiliar with that saying.” Eleya leaned over his shoulder, looking in at the rows of neatly restrained bottles.

“It’s an exclamation of surprise. Looks like they stocked this thing up before it was put into your custody. All of these bottles are new. Well, unopened at least.” Several of them had been aged decades, and the oldest bottling date he could see so far was within the last ten years. “Good selection, too. All the famous spirits... Someone sent along the most expensive sampler I’ve ever seen.”

“Ah, delightful. What should I try first?” Eleya sounded quite interested in this.

“Let’s see... How fast would you say those drop ships you flew were?” Every group of pilots had a stereotypical go-to liquor. It was split along the military and civilian divide, as well as fast and slow categories of ship - generally broken down by the amount of acceleration the ship’s frame can handle. Fast military tended towards bourbon, while slower ships went whiskey. Fast civilian was tequila, slow vodka. There were a thousand variations of course - the Scoutship program preferred rum for reasons unclear, and apparently every Trailblazer had its own moonshine setup, if not a more proper distillery. 

Eleya mulled that over. “Not particularly fast, they were not intended for anything more extensive than troop deployment. Seven hundred kilometers per hour, in atmosphere.”

Slow, then. He patted himself on the back for not saying that out loud. “Whiskey it is.” He pulled the bottle of Jameson and stood, rummaging through the drawer for a corkscrew. A few moments of messing around with that and he had a half-full lowball held out to Eleya.

She took it and sipped away. “Hm. That is unexpected.”

Alex crammed the cork back in it and set the bottle back in the rack, closing the doors. Everybody else on board was doing a job right now, no point in asking around. “How so?”

“It feels remarkably familiar. I have not had this, but it is not alien at all.” She took another sip and swirled it in her mouth, ruminating on that.

“It’s distilled grain aged in a cask.” That was most amber liquors, to his understanding. “Whatever that stuff you gave me at the restaurant reminded me of this.”

She nodded. “Grain water, yes. I can see the similarity of the two.” 

Alex blanched at that probably very literal translation, and then shrugged it off. Wasn’t like he did a lot of drinking nowadays. “Well, if you want anything else, feel free to explore. I’m gonna go bask in the warm glow of those antique monochrome holos.” He said, sliding past her and heading to the cockpit again. There wasn’t anything to do, aside from monitor things on a much bigger display, but his mind was wandering back to his earlier dilemma.

Was this moral. Was it right, was it even the threat he imagined it could be?

He slipped into the pilot’s chair and put the glasses back in their nook. Nearly an hour and 45 minutes to their destination, and they were still accelerating. Alex laughed. The shuttles were probably having to go easy on the power so they didn’t leave him in the dust. Sure, it could do a ton of stuff they couldn’t in atmo, and looked cooler even standing still, but the advance of technology had left the GX8 behind.

He still loved it. It was fantastic, and the little bit of playing around with it he had done felt just like he had expected. That he’d been gifted a ship that he had always wanted, that cost more than his parents house, the day he was supposed to deliver a intrusion package to his own government itched at the back of his mind.

Yes, she said it was supposed to be for Winter’s Nadir, their Christmas-like holiday. Just given early. Which, fine. Eleya has been acting differently since she got her implant, and probably at least her hearing fixed. Who knows what else she had been hiding. Whatever the extent of her healing, she was legitimately more pleasant to be around.

She behaved more like how Alex thought a family member should. The brief snippets of his family she had seen wouldn’t have been enough to inform her of that. Could it have been a front? Certainly. He thought Eleya had the control to do that. But what would it gain her? 

Alex knew Eleya wanted to go back to being the aunt that doted on her niece. He believed her, and knew that she couldn’t. Nothing would turn back what had happened between them. Perhaps the trust could be rebuilt. 

Perhaps she would settle for doting on her nephew for a while. He would be enthused by those easy things like ships.

That felt reasonable to Alex. It’s not like this gift was free from strings, either. He was still the backup plan if the Empire fell. If the GX8 had kinetic buffers and modern inertia dampers, it would be a proper beast in space. Outrun just about anything.

All of this felt like enough evidence that Alex was willing to believe the ship was not actually some sort of bribe to encourage him to keep the upload where he might have reconsidered.

Carbon hadn’t spoken much about what they were giving away, or the intrusion. She was annoyed that they had built an AI for something like this, but that hadn’t made her say anything about not going through with the upload. His wife clearly didn’t like that they had uploaded so much unwittingly, and she very much did want to know who was behind it.

So did he.

When they arrived on McFadden station, the ONI would get everything they wanted and more.

2024-11-03 16:27:32,"Nvidia $NVDA is reportedly discussing in investing in xAI, the AI startup by Elon Musk of Tesla $TSLA. Chipmaking giant Nvidia is in talks with Elon Musk about investing in his fast-growing artificial intelligence startup xAI, a source close to the situation said.

XAI — which powers the snarky Grok chatbot on Musk’s X social network — is in talks with some investors about raising several billion dollars at [a roughly $40 billion valuation](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/elon-musks-xai-in-talks-to-raise-funding-valuing-it-at-40-billion-af808b9e), the WSJ reported this week.

The Information reported he was talking to [strategic investors](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/musks-xai-has-discussed-raising-money-at-45-billion-valuation-from-valor-sequoia-andreessen) — meaning tech companies as opposed to investment firms — but didn’t offer any names.

Venture firms including Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Vy Capital have been included in the latest funding talks, the tech news site reported.

2024-11-03 15:44:05,"""OnDemand"" Button Nowhere to Be Found in ToS Hi everyone. I am following some YouTube tutorials to learn more about stock options trading but have hit a snag. In the tutorial I'm following, the YouTuber asks his audience to press the ""OnDemand"" button in the upper right hand corner of the ToS UI. But that button does not exist for me. I wonder if this is because his video is from 3 years ago and maybe Schwab removed the button or put it somewhere else. Thanks if anyone can offer any pointers.

2024-11-03 14:20:44,"The Contradiction of Warren Buffet's Avoidance of $TSLA Hi investing friends, helping fellow like-minded people (where's the trading/day trading swing tradaing sub-reddit of r/investing by the way?) add their fundamentals. I'm 93/7 percent believe in Warren and Elon, meaning if they say 100 things, I will most like believe 93 or them 110%:

Although Warren Buffett and we must always do our best to surpass our heroes like all Olympic records are meant to be broken (coz' in part technology, rule change and medicine advances) or NBA stars like MJ surpassing their heroes and Warren Buffett is still the genius compared to 93.% of investors and traders (the remaining 7% are the other stars like Peter Lynch), he's also made a few mistakes (Amazon is the best example coz' he always insists he doesn't understand technology which is honestly not that hard to understand but may be hard to see the road ahead when the internet was democratized including made affordable for the common working man with a decent salary ala Henry Ford's speech):

granted he loves CEOs and founders who have a laid back personality that are orthodox but orthodox in the big way, like Tim Cook, and granted TSLA is overbought by saying TSLA has the market cap of the auto industry combined vs. it's book value (math part of things, ruled by figures/number so it's more a part of technical analysis still), is he avoiding TSLA because:

a)  Elon Musk's personality is the biggest Think Big of all Think Bigs in the industrial history (way bigger than Henry Ford or Vanderbilt and the others who built industrial america which spilled to the world) and he's not comfortable with that

b) or is it because it's personal coz' they had a little war on words in the interviews and on X/formerly Twitter?

If it's about a) then it contradicts with his being on the Left mindset (a democrat, I'm with team common sense by the way at the moment coz' it has clarity, consistency and specific solutions) coz' the Left is very unorthodoxed and sometimes even comically non-sensical, going way beyond common sense.

If it's b) that's even worse, coz' one's judgment must not be clouded as Graham and Warren have though themselves, big decisions must be logical not ruled by vibes and emotions.

Thank you.

God bless fundamental and technical analysis analyzers"
2024-11-03 13:41:53,"Tesla's Resilience Tested: Will TSLA Hold Above $230 Amid Growing Market Concerns? 🔍📉🚗 **Technical Analysis**



Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) closed at $248.98 on November 1, 2024, marking a minor decline of 0.35% from the previous day. The stock has shown resilience by staying above its significant support level of $230.17, with immediate resistance at $260.48. The Relative Strength Index (RSI14) at 67 indicates that the stock is nearing overbought territory, suggesting potential consolidation or mild profit-taking in the short term. The 50-day and 200-day moving averages are standing at $233.49 and $202.31, respectively, revealing a bullish crossover pattern, which is typically seen as a positive long-term indicator. However, the MACD over a three-month period is negative at -8.13, advising caution as momentum wanes. The Average True Range (ATR) of 4.32 indicates moderate volatility, which aligns with typical movement patterns for Tesla. 



**Fundamental Analysis**



🚀 Unlock Exclusive Insights on TSLA: Get deeper analysis and expert views on TSLA's latest market trends before you read on. [Click Here to Dive In](https://stockinvest.us/stock/TSLA?sref=reddit) 🌟



Tesla's market capitalization stands at $799.24 billion, reflecting its substantial influence in the automotive and energy sectors. With an EPS of 3.65 and a high PE ratio of 68.21, Tesla is seen as a growth stock, evidenced by strong investor interest driven by its innovative leadership under Elon Musk and ventures into autonomous and renewable energies. Despite these positives, it's noteworthy that Tesla's current price of $248.98 is substantially higher than the calculated DCF value of $68.80, suggesting potential overvaluation. The latest earnings release was well-received, contributing to positive sentiment in the market. However, potential legal challenges, as indicated by the recent shareholder alert, could inject uncertainty into the stock's price stability. 



**Short-Term Prediction**



For the next trading day, November 4, 2024, Tesla may test water around the $250-$255 range, driven by recent positive earnings sentiment. However, any news affecting legal proceedings or autonomous vehicle competition could sway momentum. For the upcoming week, the stock is expected to trade within a tight range between $245 and $260, factoring in current market sentiment and technical resistance levels. 



**Intrinsic Value and Long-Term Investment Potential**



Based on various analyst price targets, which show a wide range between $85 and $600 but a consensus median of $250, Tesla's intrinsic value is contentious. The long-term prospects appear promising given the company's leadership in electric vehicles, potential growth in self-driving technology, and energy solutions. Nevertheless, the discrepancy between intrinsic valuation methods and market price hinges on Tesla's execution of its technology roadmap and maintaining leadership in a competitive and rapidly evolving sector. 



**Overall Evaluation: Hold**



Considering the technical setup with the stock trading near resistance and the fundamental narrative [...]

2024-11-01 23:15:56,"Post your earnings gains/losses so far this season with a brief thesis for why you did what you did.  I’ll go first. I’m 0/4 this season. 

TSLA - not an actual loss but decided to NOT buy a call before earnings. Because I thought margins would suck ass because they started shoveling discounts to anyone and everyone before earnings. 

MCD - only a single call on this one. Was already down from ecoli incident. CMG after their ecoli incident recovered very well. Thought MCD would do the same. Nope. 

TREE - no options this time.  Only a small position of 30 shares. Down 20%. Rates are down this business should grow and I really think their product is unique. but “consumer outlook is muted next few quarters” WTF! Fuck!

HOOD - 300 shares, down 20% ish. all their promotions hit their margins (no shit) and apparently investors don’t like it when you spend money to grow your business… FUCK!"
