Why should you automate Stock Market Price Movement Monitoring with Xq1?,"Are you looking to stay on top of stock market price movements without spending hours manually tracking them? With Xq1's instant serverless cron deployment, you can automate the monitoring process and receive timely alerts when specific thresholds are met.

To implement this automation, you can use the following Python script on Xq1:

```python
import requests
import json

def monitor_stock_price_movements():
    stock_symbol = 'AAPL'
    target_price = 150
    api_url = f'https://api.marketdataapi.com/v1/stock/{stock_symbol}/price'
    headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer your_api_key_here'}
    response = requests.get(api_url, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        stock_data = response.json()
        current_price = stock_data.get('price')
        if current_price >= target_price:
            print(f'Alert: {stock_symbol} has reached the target price of ${target_price}')
        else:
            print(f'{stock_symbol} is currently trading at {current_price}')
    else:
        print('Failed to fetch stock data')

Caste certificate doubt,"

We belong to the a reserved caste and I was born and brought up in Mumbai and so was my father. Therefore, we have documents made here however my grandfather was born in UP, migrated here for work and thus has documents from his native state. 

Now the main issue I'm facing is not being able to make a caste certificate on the basis of my father's documents, even though all of them are made here in Mumbai itself. I tried applying through the aaple sarkar portal as well and it says that my certificate will be a migrant one.
So if I do make the migrant certificate, will my Maharashtra domicile be considered as null or something? ",2024-10-25 15:55:58,3,0

Steven Cohen's Strategic Acquisition of Bright Minds Biosciences Inc Shares (NASDAQ: DRUG),"&#x200B;

**Overview of the Recent Transaction**

On October 16, 2024, Steven Cohen (Trades, Portfolio), through Point72 Asset Management, made a significant new investment in the biotechnology sector by purchasing 435,000 shares of **Bright Minds Biosciences Inc** (NASDAQ:DRUG). This transaction, executed at a price of $28.80 per share, marks a new holding for the firm and reflects a strategic move into a niche market of neuropsychiatric and pain management therapies.

**Profile of** **Steven Cohen** **(Trades,** **Portfolio**\*\*)\*\*

Steven A. Cohen, Chairman and CEO of Point72, a substantial investment firm with over 1,650 employees, is renowned for his sharp investment strategies and significant contributions to the financial markets. Starting his career at Gruntal & Co., Cohen has developed a robust investment philosophy centered around long/short equity strategies, utilizing a fundamental, bottom-up research approach. His firm manages a diverse portfolio with a strong emphasis on technology and healthcare sectors, including top holdings such as Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).

**Introduction to Bright Minds Biosciences Inc**

Bright Minds Biosciences Inc specializes in developing innovative treatments for challenging neuropsychiatric disorders, epilepsy, and pain. The company, which went public on March 8, 2021, focuses on serotonin agonists that aim to revolutionize treatment approaches for resistant medical conditions. Despite its pioneering technology, the company's financial metrics such as profitability and growth ranks remain low, indicating potential risks inherent in its developmental stage.

**Analysis of the Trade Impact**

The acquisition of Bright Minds Biosciences shares has expanded Cohen's portfolio diversity, particularly in the biotechnology sector. This new holding constitutes about 0.03% of the firm's total portfolio, with Cohen's firm now owning 9.70% of Bright Minds' total shares. This move not only underscores Cohen's confidence in Bright Minds' future but also highlights a strategic investment in a high-growth potential area within the biotech industry.

**Financial Health and Market Performance of Bright Minds Biosciences Inc**

Bright Minds Biosciences has shown a remarkable stock price increase of 70.5% since the transaction date, and an impressive 2,570.68% year-to-date growth. However, the company's financial health, as indicated by its Financial Strength and Profitability Rank, remains a concern with low scores in profitability and growth. The firm's GF Score of 39/100 suggests poor future performance potential, which could be a critical factor for potential investors to consider.

**Sector and Market Context**

The biotechnology sector is known for its high volatility and significant investment risks, balanced by the potential for substantial returns. Bright Minds, operating within this sector, faces stiff competition and regulatory challenges, common in the biotech industry. Comparatively, the firm's innovative approach in neuropsychiatric and pain management therapies sets it apart, potentially offering higher rewards for high-risk tolerant investors.

**Investment Implications**

Steven Cohen (Trades, Portfolio)'s investment in Bright Minds Biosciences could signal a bullish outlook on the company's innovative drug development pipeline, despite its current financial metrics. For investors, this move might suggest a strategic entry point into a high-potential biotech firm, albeit with considerable risk. The significant stock price increase post-transaction also indicates a positive market reception to Cohen's investment decision.

**Conclusion**

Steven Cohen (Trades, Portfolio)'s recent acquisition of shares in Bright Minds Biosciences Inc represents a calculated addition to Point72's diverse investment portfolio, focusing on a company with groundbreaking therapeutic potential. While the financial health of Bright Minds poses investment risks, the strategic nature of Cohen's investment could foresee substantial future value, aligning with his history of successful market engagements.",2024-10-25 15:18:10,0,0
"**Market Open Recap – October 25, 2024**🚨🚨📈","**Market Open Recap – October 25, 2024**

U.S. markets opened mixed this morning as investors continue to navigate a packed earnings season. **General Motors** and **GE Aerospace** both reported strong Q3 earnings, with GM posting a revenue beat and raising its year-end forecast, while GE Aerospace surpassed profit expectations on robust demand for airplane engines. However, GE’s slight miss in commercial engine revenue has tempered some enthusiasm, leading to a dip in pre-market trading.

Meanwhile, **Nvidia** is approaching Apple’s market cap milestone, continuing its impressive gains amid sustained demand for AI and advanced chip technology. The **S&P 500** and **Dow Jones** have backed off recent highs as investors assess the broader impact of rising Treasury yields, which reached 4.19% on the 10-year note earlier this week. Rising yields and mixed corporate earnings have added pressure, particularly on growth stocks.

"Market Digest (10/25) - Snapback rally, Mag 7, $AAPL, $NVDA, $DLR, $LULU, AI","Rally mode is back on. Even a downgrade of $AAPL is having no impact. It still amazes me that these analysts and their firms can get away with these ratings changes in the days leading up to an earnings report. I would like to believe that it's all on the up and up but have been in the markets too long for me to hold that view. Sometimes what is standing right in front of you is exactly what it is rather than what we want it to be. Apple was downgraded, shares up 0.75%.

Today's rally is being led by, here's a shocker, AI. Most of our complex is up about 2%, give or take. Nothing much behind it other than more wind back in the sails of the move after losing it for a bit. With $NVDA back to pressure a new high, it's possible we take that next step up after a slight pause.

And this was VERY surprising to me this AM. When sorting my 100 item quote list, I'm looking to see who is performing, who is not and the structure of what is moving into what the broader markets are doing. What is at the top of my list this AM? $DLR.  One of my multi-portfolio income holdings is up 13.50% ($22.20) this AM on the back of earnings. I took a brief look at the report and it's okay ... but not 13.5% ok. There must be something buried there that I didn't see so I'll go down the rabbit hole on this one a bit. And ... I may be trimming it in a corresponding move. I love the new high and the performance, but gaps like that are ones I often take to trim.

$LULU has gotten a bit of its mojo back this AM, up 3.8%. I sold this one something like 40 or 50 points ago to take the gain after some concern about earnings ... and I rolled the profits and $ into $ULTA instead as they are better valued, positioned, etc. I'm not seeing much to justify the move but that is a very LULU thing to say. Something is pulling them and ULTA up this AM. It may just be a retail on trade.

$NEM falling again after a poor day yesterday. That has been a material slide. Well, at least the income still looks decent but they are a perpetual poor performer earnings-wise in recent years.

Stocks I'm looking to purchase:

$LYB - Stabilizing a bit but I'm waiting before adding my next leg.

$MDT - Slipping a bit more today and I'm being patient with this one too as I look to establish a long position for the combo of value + income.

$UPS - Holding recent earnings based gains. Not sure I trust this name enough to establish a new long but I'm watching.

That's all for today's digest. Not that much going on as we end the week. I wish you all a safe and fun weekend!

"AAPL Analysis: Resistance Testing at $230, Earnings Ahead 📈📊 What's Next for Apple? 🍏💰","**Technical Analysis**



Apple Inc. (AAPL) closed on October 24, 2024, at $230.57, slightly down by 0.08%. The stock remains close to its resistance level of $230.76 and tested a low of $228.41, which aligns with its support level of $228.20. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 56, the stock is neither overbought nor oversold, indicating a balanced momentum. 



AAPL's 50-day moving average is at $226.49, and its 200-day moving average is $200.60, revealing a strong bullish trend over an extended period, as the price remains above both moving averages. The 3-month Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is positive at 2.26, supporting a bullish sentiment.

With an Average True Range (ATR) of 1.88, the stock is experiencing relatively modest volatility. Volume is below average at 29.95 million compared to the usual 50.83 million, suggesting less short-term trading activity or investor interest. 



**Fundamental Analysis**



Apple’s market cap stands at $3.51 trillion, reflecting its formidable position in the global market. The company has a P/E ratio of 35.15, which suggests a premium valuation possibly justified by its consistent growth and innovation track record. The upcoming earnings announcement on October 31, 2024, could be a pivotal moment to observe, given recent stock downgrades. 



The company's EPS of $6.56 indicates robust earnings, contributing to high investor confidence despite the recently published bearish reports. The discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis shows an intrinsic value of $148.29, much lower than the current trading price, suggesting potential overvaluation in present terms. 



**Recent News**



Recent downgrades by KeyBanc highlight potential issues with the market's reception of Apple's iPhone 16 series, citing low upgrade rates and concerns about cannibalization by the lower-cost iPhone SE. Despite these concerns, Apple is poised to release its Q4 FY'24 results soon, which could alleviate or exacerbate current investor apprehensions. 



**Short-Term Prediction**



In the immediate term, AAPL may experience minor volatility as investors interpret recent downgrades and anticipate upcoming earnings. Given current resistance and support levels, the stock is likely to continue moving within a narrow band, with an inclination towards slight depreciation if market sentiments persist negatively. 



**One-Week Outlook**



Over the next week, AAPL's performance will likely hinge on the Q4 earnings report on October 31, 2024. Should earnings exceed expectations, it may break through current resistance. Conversely, unfavorable results or further negative sentiment concerning its product lines could pressure the stock price downward. 



**Long-Term Investment Potential**



Apple remains a dominant force in the tech sector. Despite reports hinting at challenges, its established market position and proven innovation capacity provide a baseline for continued growth. However, given the DCF-derived intrinsic value and current market dialogue, careful consideration of future products' performance and market adaptability is warranted. 



**Overall Evaluation: Hold**



Given the mixed technical signals and fundamental analysis in conjunction with analyst downgrades ci [...]

PREMARKET REPORT 25/10 - Everything you need to know ahead of the trading day,"MACRO DATA:

* ECB 1 year and 3 year inflation expectations fall. This is a another indicator that inflation likely to continue to drop in Eurozone. However, in Eurozone, this is driven by demand weakness rather than any improvement in supply.

DXCM - Cautious outlook, challenges and growth concerns. US sales decline, leaves FY forecasts unchanged. 

* Stock was initially down 16%, now down 7%
* Price targets mostly cut, but bullish rating as big banks see the company as undervalued. Bernstein and JPM actually RAISED Price target. 
* In my opinion, is a hard one to play though as Hardware revenue guidance missed the market by a LOT. 

MAG 7:

* AAPl - importantly, Keybanc has downgraded AAPL to underweight, price target at 200. 
* This downgrade was driven by Consumer Survey that says that many users are looking t the iPhone SE as a viable alternative to the iPhone 16. As such, iPhone SE can cannibalise demand for iPhone 16. Also they said broad based growth expectations appear unrealistic, and with this, the valuation is expensive. 
* AAPL - Also important data from IDC who said that Q3 China smartphone sales for apple are dipping as Huawei surges. Apple sales slipped 0.3%, whilst Huawei surged 42% 
* In other news, Apple CEo met with China’s commerce minister, saying Apple will increase investments in supply chain there and will commit to long term relationship. 
* AMZN - yesterday expanded partnership with BOX to bring generative Ai to enterprise content. Integrated Amazon Bedrock with models like Anthropic’s Claude  META - Bernstein raises price target to 675 from 600. 
* MSFT - CEO pay surges 63% to $79M in 2024. 
* MSFT - Bernstein rates outperform, PT 500. Said that story is well understood. Street will be looking at Azur growth, AI tailwind, sustainability of office 365 and margins. Said more products and services. They are bullish on these elements. 
* TSLA - MSUK SAYS REPORT FROM WSJ ABOUT REGULAT CONTACT WITH PUTIN IS NOT TRUE AT AL. 

OTHER STOCKS:

* Chinese stocks higher as China’s top legislator will meet in early November amid hopes of more stimulus. 
* A number of stocks added to Oppenheimer’s Top ideas list. These include DKNG, AVGO, PINS, MA, TEAM. 
* Gold and silver stocks down slightly as Gold cools off, but is still just setting up for next leg higher. 
* CPRI tanking as their deal with Tapestry is blocked by the judge. Federal judge granted FTC’s preliminary injunction to block TPR’s acquisition of Capri.
* On this news, Evercore ISI has raised their price target on TPR to 63 from 47. Rated at outperform. They said this is positive for TPR and whilst decision can be appealed, the stock will trade like the deal is off. 
* TSM - Chip yield at TSM’s Arizona Fab exceeds Taiwan’s
* ONON moving higher in sentiment with Skechers. CROX the same
* UNH - STAT+ report says that UNH is the leading insurer profiting form billions in QUESTIONABLE medicare payments. Bad PR. 
* TXN yesterday announced it is quadrupling production of gallium nitride power semiconductors . Basically quadrupled their capacity. Can sell more = bullish
* DIS - raised at Goldman Sachs to 125 from 120, maintains at buy
* VKTX - more positive coverage from Mizuho yesterday, ""The oral is the bigger deal, especially with Novo hiccups, Viking might slide into first or second position”. Said Viking would be a good take-over candidate for big Pharma
* Boeing talks with Union ongoing

This dynamic, combined with cleaner positioning, bodes well heading into next week's Mega Cap earnings.'",2024-10-25 11:29:06,18,0
Reasons why NIFTY went down,"From highly optimistic for Indian markets to extreme fear, what exactly changed in 1 month? Listing down some of the reasons that I think may help the group. Feel free to add other reasons/correct me if wrong.

**External Reasons**

1. **US Elections:** Uncertainty in the air as both the candidates are opposite in terms of policies and will have impact on both the corporates and investors
   * **Trump:** Will focus on US companies and may have possible impact imports (tariffs, etc), though he has good relations and ideologies match with PM Modi.
   * **Kamala:** She's planning to increase the capital gains tax for both **realised/unrealised** gains for the wealthy and FIIs are in a frenzy to realize the gains before the cabinet changes. This is one of the primary reasons why Buffet sold his AAPL/BAC stake.
2. **China Stimulus:** Makes China's market more attractive
3. **Yen Carry Trade:** The risk of BOJ increasing the rate is still on the table and the involved parties may be slowly pulling out the money. It can be seen in the money inflow in Japan
4. **Hindenburg/George Soros:** They have active short positions on India, they'll obviously try to influence the market
5. **Policies by SEBI for Foreign Investors:** Stricter norms making the market non-friendly though this is good for transparency in the long run
6. **Canada:** Possible pull-out of funds from Canada due to recent dispute
7. **Middle East War:** Uncertainty in the region/may impact the Oil Prices

**Internal Reasons**

1. **Average Results:** The results lately have not been interesting
2. **Overheated Market:** Indian markets were overheated and needed some correction to cool down.
3. **RBI/Govt:** Ironically, they want the market to fall so that the retailers pull out their money and move to banks/FDs to improve the liquidity.
4. **SEBI Chairperson:** Atmosphere of lack of trust on market regulator
5. **Rate Cuts:** No rate cuts announced by RBI, even though other central banks have started the cuts
6. **Rupee Depreciation:** Continuous depreciation, near an all-time low of Rs 84.08/dollar

Now that Nifty has seen a healthy correction and most of the stocks at-least 20% down from the 52W high, strong support of 24K, Diwali, inflow of funds to retail in the next week (month end/start: Salary week), I think we may start seeing consolidation/recovery soon. We've been through a lot worse (Covid, Russia-Ukraine, etc), this too shall pass.

**Game plan**

1. **Stocks**
   * **Nullify the realised capital gains:** I plan to sell the holdings that are negative and reduce the Short-term gains to bring down the **STCG tax**. Idea is to buy them back the very next day, because if you have long term vision for the stock then why not save the tax (Sold A bought B, next day sold C and bought A, and so on).
   * **Churn the holdings:** Reconsider moving funds from overvalued to good stocks that have seen healthy correction, better chance of recovery
2. **Mutual Funds:** Weekly/fortnightly lump-sums in mutual funds based on support levels/correction
3. **Cash:** Don't go all-in instantly, hold on to cash deploy slowly over time",2024-10-25 11:27:47,30,8

6. **Rupee Depreciation:** Continuous depreciation, near an all-time low of Rs 84.08/dollar



Now that Nifty has seen a healthy correction and most of the stocks at-least 20% down from the 52W high, strong support of 24K, Diwali, inflow of funds to retail in the next week (month end/start: Salary week), I think we may start seeing consolidation/recovery soon. We've been through a lot worse (Covid, Russia-Ukraine, etc), this too shall pass.



**Game plan**

1. **Stocks**
   * **Nullify the realised capital gains:** I plan to sell the holdings that are negative and reduce the Short-term gains to bring down the **STCG tax**. Idea is to buy them back the very next day, because if you have long term vision for the stock then why not save the tax (Sold A bought B, next day sold C and bought A, and so on).
   * **Churn the holdings:** Reconsider moving funds from overvalued to good stocks that have seen healthy correction, better chance of recovery
2. **Mutual Funds:** Weekly/fortnightly lump-sums in mutual funds based on support levels/correction
3. **Cash:** Don't go all-in instantly, hold on to cash deploy slowly over time",2024-10-25 11:26:12,169,57

No display output or no hardware acceleration,"I'm aware this is a common issue, but I think I've tried almost everything that is suggested and can't seem to get a this down.    
I'm trying to install macOS Ventura  
Device is:  
Motherboard: MSI MAG B560 TOMAHAWK WIFI  
CPU: intel i9-10850k (which has intel UHD 630)  
No dedicated GPU  
  
Details about the issue: PC looses output after boot verbose, I've set up Remote management so I could check and it is in fact working properly, iGPU is detected, has hardware acceleration, displays 1.5 Gb VRAM. Now I'm using rVNC to login, the output is choppy, but I'm not to worried about that at the moment (unless someone has any ideas already). Now if I use igfxframe=0x3EA50007 or igfxvesa it boots with display, I can use HDMI output, but the GPU is displayed in About this mac, so I'm guessing it's counted as an external gpu and it only has 6MB VRAM, no hardware acceleration ((although it runs much smoother than with acceleration through rVNC, just has issues in page loading) and so on. I get that using those arguments overrides WhateverGreens configs.

I've tried using hackintool, although as per the guide, it requires the iGPU to be recognized before patching the connectors, in my case the display is not connected if iGPU is recognized, so the connectors don't provide any information about the port and so on. If I check the connectors while using igfxvesa it red highlights a connector, but displays busid and port as 0x00

 What else I've tried so far: 

* tried almost every single possible AAPL,ig-platform-id
* Various device ID's
* Manually setting the connectors with framebuffer-conX-alldata
* Changing device in SMBIOS (Tried iMac18-20, iMacPro, macMini, MacPro)
* Redoing the whole EFI folder (I've retried a clean efi configuration made step by step according to the dortania guide, also tried some other EFI's I've found on the web)
* Tried boot args I've seen people suggest
* With and without framebuffer-patch-enable, setting different stolenmem, fbmem, unifiedmem values.

I did get display when setting AAPL,ig-platform-id to 07009B3E and device-id to 9BC50000 but once again 6MB vram, no acceleration.

  
Now the interesting thing is that I've also tried installing this setup to a intel i5-10600K in a Gigabyte B460M D3H , and it has the exact same issue (I've redone the config for this one), although I've successfully setup macos and it works very smoothly installed in a DELL PRECISION 3640 i5-10600 Tower. 

I've ran the config through OC sanity check and it didn't raise any alarms.  
I'm assuming I'm missing something obvious here, I'd appreciate any ideas.

Let me know if I need to share my EFI",2024-10-25 10:30:02,1,9

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.

Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

# Apple And Goldman Sachs Ordered To Pay more Than $89 Million For Apple Card Failures

Apple’s reputation for intuitive design hit a snag with its Apple Card. 

Partnering with Goldman Sachs, Apple aimed to streamline credit card use, but the user experience didn't live up to expectations. The result? A hefty $89 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for mishandling consumer disputes and misleading customers about interest-free installment plans.

The fines, split between Apple and Goldman, come after issues that affected thousands of Apple Card users, particularly around dispute resolution and installment payment options.

**Where Apple Fell Short**  
  
At the heart of the problem was Apple's design for reporting billing errors. The process was supposed to be seamless, but many users were left frustrated when additional forms were required, and disputes weren’t properly sent to Goldman Sachs for investigation. 

On top of that, Apple’s checkout process confused customers by not making it clear they needed to opt into interest-free payments for Apple products. This led to unexpected interest charges for many.

**Goldman’s Role in the Mess**

Goldman Sachs didn’t escape the CFPB’s scrutiny either. 

The bank faced a slew of complaints over how it handled disputes once they were forwarded by Apple. Many disputes weren’t acknowledged within 30 days, and investigations often fell short of federal standards. 

The situation was worsened by Goldman’s failure to communicate how refunds and interest-free payments would work, leading some customers to rack up unnecessary interest.

While both Apple and Goldman have taken steps to resolve these issues, this situation serves as a cautionary tale about the risks of over-promising simplicity in financial products.

# TKO Group To Acquire 3 Businesses From Endeavor For $3.25 billion

TKO Group, the owner of UFC and WWE, just went shopping—and they didn’t hold back. 

In a $3.25 billion all-stock deal, TKO is scooping up three sports-related businesses from Endeavor Group: Professional Bull Riders (PBR), On Location, and IMG. Not only does this bolster TKO’s portfolio, but it also pushes Endeavor’s ownership stake in the company from 53% to a commanding 59%.

The deal isn’t just about grabbing new leagues. TKO’s getting a piece of the action in premium hospitality (On Location) and sports media rights (IMG). This move positions them as a heavyweight not only in sports leagues but in everything from ticket sales to media strategy. Sounds like TKO is aiming for a bigger slice of the sports entertainment pie.

**TKO's Stock Buyback and Dividends: Sweet Deal for Investors**  
  
Along with the big buy, TKO is treating its shareholders to a little extra love. The company announced plans to buy back up to $2 billion in stock and kick off quarterly dividends of $75 million. 

That's a solid move considering TKO's cash-generating capabilities, and it sends a clear signal: they’re serious about rewarding their investors.

TKO’s shares took a dip following the news, sliding 5.9% in early trading, but the long-term play seems geared toward solid growth. With UFC and WWE already under their belt, adding PBR and IMG only deepens TKO’s stronghold on live sports and media rights.

**What’s Next for TKO?**  
  
As TKO’s President, Mark Shapiro, pointed out, this is no small acquisition. PBR hosts over 200 events a year, while On Location is known for luxe packages at major sports spectacles like the Super Bowl and FIFA World Cup. 

IMG, on the other hand, is a major player in media rights deals for everything from the NFL to the English Premier League. That means TKO is moving beyond just operating leagues—they’re stepping into a full-scale sports entertainment empire.

No more shopping from Endeavor, though—at least for now. Shapiro made it clear that TKO’s not looking to buy more assets from its parent company. 

But as Endeavor goes private, TKO seems primed to snatch up other opportunities in the sports and entertainment world, positioning themselves as a giant in the industry.

The week fizzled out without much action on the economic front.

Durable goods—think cars, washing machines, and industrial robots (maybe) —are the heavy hitters of the manufacturing world. Tracking orders for these big-ticket items gives us a snapshot of how businesses are feeling about their future. Are they investing in long-term assets, or tightening the purse strings?

Economists are predicting a 1% drop in orders this month, a sign that the manufacturing sector is still stuck in a rut after last month’s flat performance. Looks like the industry's struggle bus isn’t pulling into the station just yet.",2024-10-25 00:31:24,2,0

# Apple And Goldman Sachs Ordered To Pay more Than $89 Million For Apple Card Failures

Apple’s reputation for intuitive design hit a snag with its Apple Card. 

Partnering with Goldman Sachs, Apple aimed to streamline credit card use, but the user experience didn't live up to expectations. The result? A hefty $89 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) for mishandling consumer disputes and misleading customers about interest-free installment plans.

The fines, split between Apple and Goldman, come after issues that affected thousands of Apple Card users, particularly around dispute resolution and installment payment options.

**Where Apple Fell Short**  
  
At the heart of the problem was Apple's design for reporting billing errors. The process was supposed to be seamless, but many users were left frustrated when additional forms were required, and disputes weren’t properly sent to Goldman Sachs for investigation. 

On top of that, Apple’s checkout process confused customers by not making it clear they needed to opt into interest-free payments for Apple products. This led to unexpected interest charges for many.

**Goldman’s Role in the Mess**

Goldman Sachs didn’t escape the CFPB’s scrutiny either. 

The bank faced a slew of complaints over how it handled disputes once they were forwarded by Apple. Many disputes weren’t acknowledged within 30 days, and investigations often fell short of federal standards. 

The situation was worsened by Goldman’s failure to communicate how refunds and interest-free payments would work, leading some customers to rack up unnecessary interest.

While both Apple and Goldman have taken steps to resolve these issues, this situation serves as a cautionary tale about the risks of over-promising simplicity in financial products.

# TKO Group To Acquire 3 Businesses From Endeavor For $3.25 billion

TKO Group, the owner of UFC and WWE, just went shopping—and they didn’t hold back. 

In a $3.25 billion all-stock deal, TKO is scooping up three sports-related businesses from Endeavor Group: Professional Bull Riders (PBR), On Location, and IMG. Not only does this bolster TKO’s portfolio, but it also pushes Endeavor’s ownership stake in the company from 53% to a commanding 59%.

The deal isn’t just about grabbing new leagues. TKO’s getting a piece of the action in premium hospitality (On Location) and sports media rights (IMG). This move positions them as a heavyweight not only in sports leagues but in everything from ticket sales to media strategy. Sounds like TKO is aiming for a bigger slice of the sports entertainment pie.

**TKO's Stock Buyback and Dividends: Sweet Deal for Investors**  
  
Along with the big buy, TKO is treating its shareholders to a little extra love. The company announced plans to buy back up to $2 billion in stock and kick off quarterly dividends of $75 million. 

That's a solid move considering TKO's cash-generating capabilities, and it sends a clear signal: they’re serious about rewarding their investors.

TKO’s shares took a dip following the news, sliding 5.9% in early trading, but the long-term play seems geared toward solid growth. With UFC and WWE already under their belt, adding PBR and IMG only deepens TKO’s stronghold on live sports and media rights.

**What’s Next for TKO?**  
  
As TKO’s President, Mark Shapiro, pointed out, this is no small acquisition. PBR hosts over 200 events a year, while On Location is known for luxe packages at major sports spectacles like the Super Bowl and FIFA World Cup. 

IMG, on the other hand, is a major player in media rights deals for everything from the NFL to the English Premier League. That means TKO is moving beyond just operating leagues—they’re stepping into a full-scale sports entertainment empire.

No more shopping from Endeavor, though—at least for now. Shapiro made it clear that TKO’s not looking to buy more assets from its parent company. 

But as Endeavor goes private, TKO seems primed to snatch up other opportunities in the sports and entertainment world, positioning themselves as a giant in the industry.

Do I understand it correctly?,"Good evening everyone.

I am relatively new into dividend investing and covered call etfs. So I recently discovered XDTE / RDTE / QDTE and I wanted to see if I understand the calculation correctly.

My main question is what technically prevents someone from selling 30k $ worth of AAPL for example and buy RDTE instead to earn weekly income and reinvest it back to RDTE growing the position every week?

Do i understand correctly that if (very rogue example) RDTE pays 0.30 cents per share weekly, someone owning 700 shares will earn 210$/ week? Minus 15% tax that leaves with ~180$ pure profit a week?

Or my calculations are flawed?

What are the risks of holding such etf in a huge amount of shares?

Thank you everyone and my apologies if questions are stupid.",2024-10-25 00:11:06,1,19

Their earnings are 11/2, 3 days before election. Berkshire has never seen volatility like it has recently and that will play a huge factor in is price action. The company's core assets reside in sectors such as insurance, energy, and consumer goods. Recently they sliced their holding of $AAPL in half, reducing their position to only 2.6% of the outstanding shares. Even after concluding their sales $AAPL remains Berkshires largest holding at roughly 30% of their portfolio. Furthermore, their cash balance sits at a whopping $277 billion.

With a market capitalization of $3.51 trillion, Apple remains a dominant player in its sector. The company's current EPS is $6.56, and the P/E ratio is 35.15, suggesting a high valuation relative to earnings. The discounted cash flow (DCF) model gives an intrinsic value of $147.52, which is significantly lower than the current market price, implying that the stock is overvalued in its present state. The consensus price target is $234.48, reinforcing a modest upside potential. Analysts' sentiment reflects a strong buying interest with 1 'strong buy', 28 'buy', 13 'hold', 2 'sell', and 0 'strong sell' ratings, aligning with an overall 'Buy' consensus. 



**News Impact and Upcoming Events**



Recent news highlights Apple's competitive position in AI and strong performance in China, especially in iPhone 16 sales, suggesting potential catalysts for future growth. An upcoming earnings announcement on October 31, 2024, is closely watched; it could significantly impact the stock price due to anticipated volatility. Analysts predict robust earnings supported by a capital-light model increasing economic earnings above accounting EPS. 



**Intrinsic Value and Long-Term Potential**



While the current market price is above its intrinsic value, long-term growth drivers, including AI integration and expanding subscription revenues, offer substantial potential. As the company continues to innovate and maintain a strong operating base, its long-term fundamentals remain solid despite short-term overvaluation. 



**Overall Evaluation: Hold**

Updates On Apple’s $490M Investor Settlement,"Hey guys, I posted about this settlement already, but since we have an update for it, I decided to post it again. In case you missed it, it's about Tim Cook’s comments about China’s sales back in 2018.So, if you checked the news in 2018, those comments were before the first Apple's revenue cut and loss of more than $70B with the stock fall.



During the call in the same 2018, he said that though Apple had sales problems in a few countries with high inflation rates (like Brazil and Russia), there were no such problems for China. But then, just a few days later, Apple cut production and requested it from the suppliers, so I think it was obviously otherwise.



And just two months later, Apple shocked everyone with its first announcement about the revenue cut since the iPhone establishment in 2007, causing AAPL to drop by 10% and resulting in 70B losses.



This was the reason for several scandals and lawsuits based on Cook's comments, but Apple denied that they had any wrongdoing in this case (and they continue to deny it to this day).



So, this whole story is going to an end because recently Apple decided to pay $490M to investors due to the situation (even before the court hearing). And  I just found out that even though the deadline already passed, they are taking late claims on this. So if you were hit by this, you can [check it out](https://11thestate.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement).



However, does that half a billion even come close to covering the $70 billion loss? Especially with all the drama Apple's dealing with in China?

40m looking to retire at 55,"As the title state I’m hoping to retire at 50- 55 but I want to up my dividend game. I’m currently at 4k a year in dividends. I’m in aapl 65%,voo 5% ,schd 10% and o 20%. I own alot of Apple bc I bought years ago and I felt it was a safe bet. I just started adding to voo and schd recently and o I’ve owned for a few years.

Anyway my question is at 40 what you consistently add to? What I have or is there something better ? Im not adding to aapl im talking about an etf obviously. I’m looking for a little growth and strong dividends. I wanna get to about 15k - 20k a year. I have real estate that I will live off of but still want some steady dividend income.

* **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
* **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.
* **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.
* **Expiration:** 2024-10-25.
* **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""
* **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.
* **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.
* **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.",2024-10-24 14:00:18,7,0

"S&P 500 Is Sky-High, But Are We About to Crash?","Alright, so the S&P 500 is chilling at record highs, but let’s not kid ourselves — this party might be winding down. With 20% of companies about to drop their earnings, and the index now leaning hard on just three heavyweights ($AAPL, $NVDA, and $MSFT), I'm starting to wonder if the market's pushing its luck. These three giants alone make up over 20% of the index’s value. That’s insane. When you have that kind of concentration, any stumble from one of them could shake the whole house of cards.

Now, Goldman Sachs isn't exactly giving us a reason to pop champagne either. They’re forecasting a major slowdown for the U.S. stock market, with expected annual returns on the S&P 500 shrinking to just 3%. Compare that to the 13% we’ve been loving for the last decade. Yeah, not looking too hot. And to make matters worse, there’s a solid 72% chance the index could start lagging behind U.S. Treasury yields — a safe but kinda boring alternative.

Oh, and speaking of risk, insiders are offloading their stocks like it’s the end of the world. Insider selling is hitting a 3-year high, and that’s not a great sign. It seems like the ones in the know are cashing out before the next downturn hits. Combine that with rising bond yields and hedgies piling into long positions, and you’ve got a recipe for volatility.",2024-10-24 13:36:16,2,0

Come on Bulls! It is better than I expected Details why! NOW had 23% growth and PE is 66, TSLA back 100+","Good morning everyone. At the bottom yesterday the SP was down about 1.25%. 2 straight down days of 3% or more are downside conviction for me… or 3% in 1 single day \[Daily crash\]….. or 8 of last 10 days red for 4%+. Once I saw us down so much, I decided to stay on the sidelines. There were many good deals, but we are way overbought. It is working though. We just keep heading higher. Even Goldman, 1 of the most highly respected firms put out a report a few days ago stating that they do not see much upside for the next several years…… I agree! This is because so much perfection is priced in… There is no doubt in my mind that eventually we will see 275 earnings…. 300 earnings… Companies always find a way to figure it out… Short term, Harris victory would be bad for the market… this is because she wants to raise capital gains, raise corporate taxes, tax buybacks etc… long term, companies will figure it out…

What Warren Buffet always says, is buy a company and invest in a company where you know they will always adapt. Where you can go away for 1,3,5,10 years come back and they figured out how to do it… When you have the SP500, you have the worlds greatest 500 companies in 1 single basket… if a company does not do well, it is swapped out by something else. You also get the diversification… this is why you can set it, and forget it! When you buy 1 single stock, you are putting your faith in 1 CEO, in 1 group of management and expect them to figure it out, adapt in tough times. We are very high now, so I am being very careful with my buys… Momentum works, but if we start selling off, fair value is close to 4,800 based on earnings that we got at the moment….

 

I spent nearly 3 hours on earnings so I will have to cut this short as it is already 9:05AM and I started with earnings about 6:30.

TSLA earnings were bad. Let us get this straight. When analyst make an estimate there are just 2  numbers you are required to beat.

Sales and Earnings

For me, you must beat both sales and earnings to earn a 65. If you beat 1 of these 2 by a lot maybe, I give you a 65? But you must see why that is, that they beat 1 and missed the other.

What I can say, is that the TSLA earnings were better than I expected.

I was impressed with the 2.7 Billion free cash flow. \[lower than GM which is 95% cheaper as a 60 billion dollar company with a 5x PE ratio LOL!\]

I was also impressed that full operating margins came in at 10.8%

Last quarter it was 6.3%, 2 quarters ago a like other car companies 5.5… 3 quarters ago 8.2%

So, the 10.8% was indeed impressive. I do like that they have diversified and have good growth in other sectors, like energy… This probably helped a lot with margins. Also, they were able to bring down avg cost of a car to 35,100 which was a record low… These were good numbers.. .I give credit where it is due….

They did beat my expectations and grew earnings at 9%.... sales grew by 7.8%. \[I knew they could not do the 20/10 \[20 growth/10 earnings\] I didn’t think they would do the 10/5 but they did do 8 and 9 which is not bad… An issue here is that they had the 2^(nd) largest reg credits ever! 739 million! This padded earnings by nearly 20 cents!!! \[This is a coupon TSLA is allowed to sell other car OEMs not to get fined for not doing EV vehichles.. by the way, Trump may take away those fines, so you can not count on Reg sales forever\]

The most trouble is the valuation.

Let us push earnings up to 2.50 and let us say you love it and give it a 40x…

40 x 2.50 = 100

Let us call this a tech/software company like NOW \[Who grew sales at 23% and earnings at 15%\] NOW has much larger margins…. NOW has a PE of 60!

60 x 2.50 = 150

So, do you see the problem with TSLA 240? It is trading at a far higher premium than NVDA NOW PANW SMCI AMD MSFT AAPL GOOG AMZN NFLX …

So, not only are the earnings bad, as they missed top line. The valuation is insane…

I will admit, there were very good things on the report….

8% growth and 9% earnings… I still wouldn’t give that 40x! LOL

35 x 2.50 = 88 dollars current fair value…

I am not a hater.. Why does this trade at a higher premium than those 10 companies just mentioned? Please explain to me.

Numbers do not have opinions!

 

5 Trade Ideas:

ACMR – It hit 18.80 but I didn’t pull the trigger

 

MU – Wow dropped to about 103.50 was worried

 

ZIM – it went flying as a competitor revised up, fell to 22

STX – Awesome earnings dropped near 102 I didn’t pull

 

MODV – Back down to 13.50 after they said they collected funds, it was just 19!

Three stocks that you feel will outperform the market over the next 5 years,"Like the title says: which three stocks, individual equities, do you believe will outperform the market, Market Index Funds: VOO, ONEQ, or DIA?

My takes:

COST -- Costco has a great expansion model, a great business model, and loyalty like few other companies: customer, employee, and vendors.

AAPL -- I continue to see them innovate, they won't stick with something that isn't working, and their stuff just works.

Third slot is a bit tougher: GOOG, NVDA, or JPM in that order.

"Trimming positions, then what?","Reading lots of posts regarding trimming, mostly pre-earnings. I understand the overweight logic ✅

It’s not something I have a strategy or plan. 
So if you are long as in 10+ years, and say you have large gains in NVDA, AAPL, Amzn etc… if it drops 5% in a few weeks around earnings, recovers in 2-3 months to breach ATH. 

Is it really worth the additional admin, trying to time re-entry? Rather than sitting it out as you are long term anyway. 

Would this also be the same strategy for funds and ETF’s to cash in gains and re-enter, or should it be VOO and chill as the pullbacks should be less volatile than individuals. 

I may have answered my own questions with having a plan/strategy.

Apple Stock Plan advice ,"Hey everyone, 

I have 157 shares of AAPL from an old employee stock plan when I used to work for Apple. The current value is about $36k. 

Is it best just to leave it alone or is there something strategic I can do with this account? 

Btw I stopped working for Apple in late 2020 and haven’t contributed to this account since I was an employee. 

Here’s a rough breakdown of my current investments. 26M

-Roth IRA: $24k 
-Old 401k: $9.5k

# Tesla Notches a Blowout Quarter on Strong Sales, Credits

Tesla is back in the fast lane. 

The EV giant reported third-quarter earnings that blew past Wall Street expectations, clocking in at 72 cents per share and ending a four-quarter losing streak. 

Demand for Tesla’s cars rebounded in a big way, with CEO Elon Musk forecasting a potential 20-30% growth in deliveries next year. Shares surged 12% in late trading, marking a sharp turnaround for the stock, which had been down 14% this year.

Tesla’s quarterly win wasn’t just about sales, though. The company raked in $739 million from regulatory credits—selling them to carmakers who need help meeting emissions targets. It’s clear that Tesla’s profits are being boosted not only by the cars on the road but also by the deals happening behind the scenes.

**Driving Growth with New Models and Margins**  
Musk’s big plans don’t stop there. Tesla reiterated its commitment to rolling out more affordable models by 2025, while its futuristic Cybertruck is finally profitable after a production ramp-up. And there’s more good news: Tesla’s gross margin (excluding credits) jumped to 17.1% from 14.6% last quarter.

The company is also steering full throttle into autonomous driving. Musk teased a robotaxi service, set to launch in Texas and California next year. If the tech holds up (and regulators play ball), this could be a game-changer for Tesla’s future business model.

**What’s Next?**  
While Tesla’s recent results are impressive, challenges lie ahead. T

he company faces stiff competition from Chinese automakers like BYD, along with legacy brands such as Ford and GM stepping up their EV game. Tesla also needs a strong Q4 to top last year’s deliveries, and heavy price cuts could keep pressuring its margins.

Still, with its sights set on affordable models and a driverless future, Tesla seems ready to ride out the storm. Investors are watching closely to see if this momentum can carry the stock even higher.

# Arm to Scrap Qualcomm Chip Design License, Feud Escalates

Arm just threw a major curveball at Qualcomm. 

The UK-based chip designer is pulling the plug on a key license agreement, giving Qualcomm 60 days to fix their messy legal spat or risk losing access to critical tech. 

Qualcomm, known for powering most Android smartphones, might be forced to stop selling its flagship processors if it can’t resolve the issue.

This isn’t just a minor tiff—both companies took a hit. Arm’s shares dropped 6.67%, and Qualcomm’s fell 3.8% as the markets weighed the potential fallout of this escalating feud. If the license gets scrapped, Qualcomm’s $39 billion chip business could be on the chopping block.

**Why the Beef?**  
The bad blood dates back to 2022 when Arm sued Qualcomm for breach of contract over its acquisition of Nuvia, a chip-design startup. 

Qualcomm says the lawsuit is just Arm trying to strong-arm (pun intended) them into paying higher royalties. Now, Arm’s stepping things up by threatening to cancel Qualcomm’s rights to use its chip architecture.

Qualcomm has big plans for Nuvia’s tech—its AI-driven PC processors are already hitting the market. If Arm’s move sticks, Qualcomm may need to scrap Nuvia’s designs entirely, a costly setback that could give competitors a golden opportunity.

**What’s Next?**  
With a December trial looming, many see Arm’s license termination as a bargaining chip to gain leverage. 

Qualcomm, however, is no stranger to courtroom drama, having settled disputes with Apple and Nokia in the past. A settlement seems likely, but if not, both companies could face serious damage.

Buckle up, because tomorrow's reports might actually stir the pot. First up, initial jobless claims—one of the Fed's favorite labor market indicators—dropped by 19,000 last week to 241,000. This week? Economists expect a small bump to 245,000, but that’s likely just seasonal noise.

Also on the radar: new home sales for September, with hopes of a slight rise from 716,000 to 720,000, and the S&P’s Purchasing Manager Index for services and manufacturing. Let's see if these numbers bring some real movement.
